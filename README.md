# isp-peering-performance-logger

Tools for gathering and visualizing some ISP download data due to problems with my DSL. Probably ISP peering related.
Results will be on https://blog.fpetersen.eu

Data can is gathered using `measure_download_speed.sh`.

Raw result data in `home.log` and `hetzner.log`.

Visualizations can be created using the `create_charts_*.py` python files.
